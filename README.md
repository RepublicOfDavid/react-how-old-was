# Actor age lookup app

**Ever been watching a film and wondered how old the actor was when they starred in it? I do it wayyyyyyy too often, so often infact I built an app to quickly look that information up!**

**JS Framework:** React (Version 17)<br>
**CSS Framework:** react-bootstrap<br>
**External Dependencies:** [https://www.themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org) *- RESTful API*

**Purpose of demo:** Demonstrate fetching data from an API and displaying it.

**To view locally run:**
- npm install
- npm start

The app should then load on http://localhost:3000/

There is some mock json data when testing locally as the API key used for the real call is private.

**View:** [Frontend](https://howoldwas.netlify.app "See the front end in action")
